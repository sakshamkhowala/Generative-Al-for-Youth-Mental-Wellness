## 🔧 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com
2. Sign up/login
3. Navigate to "API Keys"
4. Click "Create new secret key"
5. Copy the key (starts with "sk-...")
6. Add $5+ credits in the Billing section

### Step 2: Set Up the Backend
1. **Download all files** from the deployment
2. **Create the folder structure**:
   ```
   your-project/
   ├── index.html
   ├── style.css
   ├── app.js
   ├── server.js
   ├── package.json
   └── .env
   ```

3. **Create `.env` file**:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   PORT=3001
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Start the backend**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Step 3: Run the Frontend
1. **Use VS Code Live Server** (recommended):
   - Right-click `index.html` → "Open with Live Server"
   - Opens at http://127.0.0.1:5500

2. **Or use Python**:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

### Step 4: Test the Real AI
1. **Open the frontend** in your browser
2. **Navigate to AI Chat section**
3. **Send a message**: "I'm feeling anxious about my exams"
4. **Watch the magic**: Real GPT-3.5 response!

## 🎯 What Makes This Special

### Real AI Features:
- **Genuine conversations** using OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
- **Context memory** across the conversation
- **Crisis detection** with real AI understanding
- **Empathetic responses** engineered specifically for mental health
- **Professional boundaries** built into the system prompt

### Demo Scenarios for Hackathon:

## 📊 Demo Script for Judges

### Opening (30 seconds):
"We've built a real AI-powered mental health platform that addresses the youth mental health crisis. Unlike other chatbots with pre-scripted responses, ours uses OpenAI's GPT models for genuine, empathetic conversations."

### Technical Demo (2 minutes):
1. **Show normal conversation** - demonstrate natural AI responses
2. **Trigger crisis detection** - show immediate safety protocols
3. **Demonstrate context memory** - AI remembers previous topics
4. **Show mobile responsiveness** - works on all devices

### Impact Discussion (1 minute):
"1 in 5 young people experience mental health challenges, but many don't seek help due to stigma or accessibility. Our platform provides 24/7 support with real AI that can have genuine conversations while maintaining safety protocols."

### Technical Highlights (1 minute):
"We've integrated OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo with a specialized system prompt for mental health support, implemented crisis detection algorithms, and built a full-stack application with proper error handling and security measures."

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### If Backend Won't Start:
- Check that your OpenAI API key is in the `.env` file
- Verify you have credits in your OpenAI account
- Make sure port 3001 isn't being used by another application

### If Frontend Can't Connect:
- Verify the backend is running on http://localhost:3001
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Ensure CORS is properly configured

### If AI Responses Are Slow:
- This is normal - real AI takes 2-3 seconds to respond
- Much more impressive than instant pre-scripted responses!

## 🎉 You're Ready to Win!

Your platform now has:
- ✅ Real AI conversations
- ✅ Crisis intervention
- ✅ Professional architecture
- ✅ Significant social impact
