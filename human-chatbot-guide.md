## üé≠ Sample Conversations to Show Judges:

### Demo Script 1 - Natural Flow:
**You**: "Hi, I'm having a tough day"
**AI**: "Hi there! I'm really glad you're here. I'm sorry to hear you're having a tough day - that can feel so draining. What's been making it particularly difficult for you?"

**You**: "School stress and friend drama"
**AI**: "Wow, that really is a lot to handle all at once - school pressure and friend issues can each be exhausting on their own. No wonder you're feeling overwhelmed. Would you like to talk about what's happening with your friends, or is the school stress feeling more urgent right now?"

### Demo Script 2 - Crisis Response:
**You**: "I feel like giving up"
**AI**: "I'm really concerned about what you've shared with me, and I want you to know that your life has so much value. What you're feeling right now is incredibly painful, but there are people specifically trained to help with exactly these feelings. Can you reach out to one of them? I'll stay here with you while you do."
